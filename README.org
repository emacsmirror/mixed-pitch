#+TITLE: Mixed Pitch

Mixed pitch is a minor mode that enables mixing fixed-pitch (also known as
fixed-width or monospace) and variable-pitch (AKA "proportional") fonts. It
tries to be smart about which fonts get which face. Fonts that look like code,
org-tables, and such remain fixed-pitch and everything else becomes
variable-pitch. The variable ~mixed-pitch-fixed-pitch-faces~ is a list of faces
that will remain fixed-pitch in mixed-pitch-mode:

* Installation
~mixed-pitch~ is on MELPA. Set up MELPA and then you can simply do ~M-x package-install mixed-pitch~.
* Configuration
If you use =use-package=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mixed-pitch
    :hook
    ;; If you want it in all text modes:
    (text-mode . mixed-pitch-mode))
#+END_SRC
* Known issues
** org SRC blocks shown in variable pitch
~mixed-pitch.el~ relies on a face introduced in org version 9.0 to make SRC blocks
fixed-pitch. Without this, some things in source blocks may appear
variable-pitch. The solution is to update your version of org. As a workaround,
consider adding org-block to ~~mixed-pitch-fixed-pitch-faces~. See also the
discussion in issue #2.
** Interaction with company
If you use company for autocompletion, results in the popup window may
appear to zig-zag. A workaround is to install and use [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/company-box][company-box]] or
[[https://github.com/tumashu/company-childframe][company-childframe]]. As a bonus, this is currently much faster than
company's built-in mechanism.
